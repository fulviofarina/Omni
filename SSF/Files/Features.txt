Hi, this message is to inform you that new features were added/changed!



----  05-06-12 Update ----------------------

- In the subsamples module you can choose wether a) the radius or b) the filling height should be auto-adjusted 
based on the sample density. Check the "Options" menu. 
This is done only when the density given and the one calculated do not agree base on the given sample dimensions.
Changing this option does not automatically adjust the radius or fill height of the shown cells.
It will do it if you refresh the project and if necessary.

- To restore a default "factory" value of a cell put 0. 
If 0 is not a valid value for this cell the program will try to find the default value from the database. 
The exceptions are:
a)the "f" cell which can actually be 0, so put a negative number to override it.
b) Any cell that contains Date/Time data.


- This text can be accessed again by Right-click on the notifier and a click on "Help"



------------------ 02-03-12 Kind of User Guide --------------------------

- White cells need to be filled in manually, colored cells are calculated or are just read-only.

- The right-click contextual menu should be your best tool. Every table has one, everything that is not inputted manually
 should be inputted throught this menu. Also, every table reacts to the same shortcuts commands.

- In general, if supressing a value from a cell only gives you again the same old value, this probably means it is being recalculated automatically.
This might be frustrating, but that is exactly the heart of the program. 
It replaces NULLs for values, that are automatically found when available, so your input should be minimal, and in principle, your workload.

If the cell has the wrong value, set the correct one directly or put 0 to make the system understand you are actually putting a value,
because NULL is not a value, it is the absence of it

Example: a given channel has an f and alpha value. Suppose you want to tweak them. By supressing them
the system will try to put back the original values from that channel. Instead, putting the new values directly should work.

- If the samples have different irradiation date/times, you can set them one by one of course.
If the samples share the same irradiation time, its better if you copy/paste it from a given sample or use the "Propagate this Irr..." button.
That saves considerable time and will also guarantee you that all of them have the same irradiation data. It can be dangerous when you do it manually
 (except for S84 because there's no other way)

 
------------------ Older Features --------------------------

- Cloning of rows is now possible by pressing CTRL+T after selecting any given row.

------------------ Older Features --------------------------

The Irradiation Capsules table is gone. Therefore the ENAA field must be checked directly at the Sample's module.

------------------ Older Features --------------------------

-- Right click on a sample to propagate its irradiation date/time to all other samples (i.e. irradiations on Y4, X26)

You can now press CTRL+E to export the table to an XML file for reading later in Excel.

In the same fashion, you can press CTRL+L to load a table with data from a XML file.


------------------ Older Features --------------------------

Any LIMS interface (Monitors, SubSamples, Geometries, Vials, etc) shares the following features so you can make the best out of a keyboard:

CTRL+C to <copy> and/or CTRL+V to <paste> after you have selected the <source> and/or <destination> cells, respectively,
CTRL+S to <Save> (same as pressing the Disk logo),
CTRL+Z to <Undo> the last changes (if you have not saved them) or,
CTRL+R to <Refresh> the whole table (reload it from the SQL-database)

Changes you make are automatically detected and the Save icon (Disk) will be enabled.
